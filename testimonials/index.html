We rarely meet people in our lives that have such an effect on the outcome of our lives. You are someone who has changed my life completely and for the better. I am now a much more successful student than I once was and I attribute that greatly to you and the help you have provided for me. I wish you the very best of luck in your future, and I hope to see you again after I graduate.&quot;</i></p>

Personally, I have worked with Mrs. Friedman for two years, and she has made a big difference in my grades and outlook on academic life and more. She is always available to talk, whether it is about grades, college or an outside issue that I am having. Mrs. Friedman is an enlightened character who brings out the best in her students and peers.&quot;</i></p>
